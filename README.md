# CS416: Operating Systems Design (Fall 2020)
This repository is a compilation of files my group produced in CS416, an operating systems course taught by Badri Nath at Rutgers in Fall 2020.

**Note**: Rutgers University's Academic Integrity Policy prohibits students from plaigirizing schoolwork, including that done in CS416. This repository is only used to support group collaboration and does not attempt in any way to support acts of academic dishonesty.
